        <h2>Counter-Composition XIII (Theo Van Doesburg 1925-26)</h2>
        <p>
            Van Doesburg created this Counter-Composition in response to Piet Modrian's insistence upon strictly using vertical or horizontal lines in artwork.
            This method of Piet's is known as Neo-Plasticism, and the variant that Van Doesburg created was a modification of Neo-Plasticism known as Elementarism.
            An example of this can be seen in this <a href="painting_static.html">static painting</a> or this <a href="painting_animated.html">interactive version</a>.
