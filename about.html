        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am an incoming graduate student at Western Washington University, pursuing my MS in Computer Science. 
            I am especially interested in applications of machine learning, and I expect my graduate research to be focused around analyzing methods of tensor reconstruction. 
            During undergrad, my interest in coursework was centered around algorithms and mathematics studies for which I took several optimization and computation courses, and as such my elective coursework was focused mainly on linear algebra. 
            I also have a background in data visualization as my undergraduate group research project, called Brainviewer, was a GUI to display the projected connection strength between various points in the brains of mice. 
            Towards the end of my undergraduate studies I began to gain a stronger interest in machine learning and applying mathematics to other fields outside of Computer Science, which I hope to get more experience doing during my graduate studies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of my research interests I enjoy playing chess, building computers and custom keyboards.
        </p>
